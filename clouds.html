        <h1 id="clouds">Clouds Parasite</h1>

        Clouds Parasite is an alternative firmware
        for <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/clouds/">Clouds</a>. It
        adds the following main features to the module:
        <ul>
          <li>The <b>Oliverb</b>, a new, full-featured creative reverb
            mode based on the reverb of the original firmware (itself
            based on a description of the Lexicon 480L), and inspired
            in design by
            the <a href="http://www.makenoisemusic.com/erbe-verb.html">Erbe</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151202180930/http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/595M/?p=1373">Verb</a>,
            with CV control over all parameters. It is largely
            modeless, probably unrealistic and goes far beyond your
            traditional reverb;</li>
          <li><b>Resonestor</b>, a polyphonic resonator processor with
            built-in support for your beloved Karplus-Strong
            synthesis. Plucked or fed with your favorite sound, it spits
            out strange guitar sounds, lush chords, evolving
            drones, and more.
          </li>
          <li><b>More envelopes</b> for your grains: the Texture knob
            allows to select ramp down or ramp up-shaped
            grains. Square-shaped grains have steeper edges for extra
            glitch;</li>
          <li>Availability of much <b>smaller grains</b> compared to
            the official firmware, and asymmetrical grain envelopes
            (saws, ramps).</li>
          <li><b>Enhanced looping delay</b> and <b>time stretcher</b>
          modes: tempo syncing with clock multiplier/divisor, support
          for <b>stereo delay</b> (ping-pong delay) and
          (crude) <b>open feedback loop</b>, much improved sound
          quality, faster delay time change.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The four original modes, including the granular of the
          official firmware are still present, but have been
          tweaked/extended to my preference. Please carefully read the
          documentation below </p>

        <h2>IMPORTANT WARNINGS</h2>

        <ul class="warn">

          <li><i>(2015-07-09)</i> If you purchased your Clouds on or
          after July 2015, please use Clouds Parasite version >=
          1.3. Earlier versions might not work properly.</li>
          <li><i>(2015-06-06)</i> Some cases of bricking (updates that
          leaves Clouds non-functional) have been reported with
          previous versions of this firmware, very roughly 1% of the
          time. Their causes were unknown, but all could be repaired
          with a FTDI or JTAG adapter and a computer. Mutable
          Instruments will not support unbricking; I can do my best to
          help (provide detailed instructions or local help). Be aware
          of the risk before updating!
          </li>
          <li> <i>(2015-04-27)</i> If your module has a serial number
            that ends with number less than 020, you should contact
            Mutable Instruments: your Clouds might have a faulty
            bootloader which could brick the unit if you try to update
            it.
          </li>

          features added/modified.</p>

        <p>Here is a <a href="images/clouds-cheat-sheet.pdf">cheat sheet</a>, thanks

        <h3 id="mode">Mode-switching interface</h3>

        To switch mode, press both black buttons simultaneously. LEDs
        will blink orange; you can then press the <b>Blend</b>
        or <b>Load/Save</b> button to navigate forward/backward into
        the modes.

        <h3 id="oliverb">Oliverb mode</h3>

        <p>The Oliverb is a full-featured and CV-controllable modeless
        reverb with some twists.</p>

        <iframe width="100%" height="315"
                src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/apgmvYbG_zQ?rel=0"
                frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <iframe width="100%" height="250" scrolling="no" frameborder="no"
                src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/95985017%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-8Zeyz&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

        <p>You access the new Oliverb mode like the other factory
          playback modes: press both black buttons <b>Blend button</b>
          (LEDs blink orange) and press one of the two buttons until
          the last three are lit (<i>i.e.</i> only the first LED is
          unlit). This mode is mono-in, stereo-out. The reverb
          parameter can be controlled by the knobs and CV inputs:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Pre-delay</dt>
          <dd>The <b>Position</b> knob controls the time it take for
            the reverb to kick in after a sound has gone in (from 0
            to about half a second). When a clock is fed to
            the <b>Trig</b> input, this knob becomes a clock
            divider/multiplier for the pre-delay: at 12 o'clock, the
            pre-delay takes the value of the clock length;
            clockwise, this clock is divided, and counter-clockwise
            it is multiplied following the rates: 1/16, 3/32, 1/8,
            3/16, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 3/4, 1, 3/2, 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 6/1,
            8/1, 12/1 (borrowed from the Echophon). Note that the
            clock division is limited to the largest division not
            exceeding the maximum delay; beyond this point, the
            Position knob will have no effect. Changing pre-delay
            in real time is smooth and does not affect pitch (it
            uses the internal time stretcher).
          </dd>
          <dt>Reverb Size</dt>
          <dd>The <b>Size</b> knob controls the lengths of all the
            delays internal to the reverb, i.e. the size of the
            emulated room. It varies from a small resonator to a
            huge hall. </dd>
          <dt>Decay</dt>
          <dd>The <b>Density</b> knob controls the amount of sound
            fed back into the reverb loop, i.e. the decay time of the
            reverb tail. Beyond 3 o'clock, this signal is actually
            amplified and the reverb enters self-oscillation.</dd>
          <dt>Pitch shift</dt>
          <dd>Each time the sound is fed back into the reverb, it
            can be pitch shifted. The <b>Pitch</b> knob controls,
            from -1 to +1 octaves how it is pitch shifted. At 12
            o'clock, no pitch shifting is applied; fully clockwise,
            we get the
            classic <a href="https://valhalladsp.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/enolanois-shimmer-sound-how-it-is-made/">shimmer
              effect</a>; lots of oddities can be found in between. To
            hear the effect of the pitch shifter, some sound has to
            fed back by increasing Decay. Note that <b>Size</b> has
            an impact on how well the sound is pitch-shifted: the
            larger the room size, the more accurate the pitch shift.
          </dd>
          <dt>Dampening</dt>
          <dd>The <b>Texture</b> knob controls the dampening of the
            reverb. From fully CCW to 12 o'clock, a low-pass filter is
            applied, simultaing the absorption of the room. From 12
            o'clock to fully CW, a high-pass filter is applied for
            unusual, crystalline effects.</dd>
          <dt>Freeze</dt>
          <dd>The <b>Freeze</b> button sets reverb to (near)
            infinite decay, and mutes the input. This works best with
            no pitch shifting and a large size.</dd>
          <dt>Dry/Wet</dt>
          <dd>The first function of the <b>Blend</b> knob is dry/wet
            crossfading, as in the other modes.</dd>
          <dt>Diffusion</dt>
          <dd>The <b>second Blend mode</b> (called "stereo spread")
            controls how much the sound is "smoothened" by the
            diffusers each time it goes through the loop. Fully
            clockwise, you get the more dense, continuous sound; fully
            counter-clockwise, you clearly hear the sound being
            repeated like in a multi-tap delay.</dd>
          <dt>Modulation amount</dt>
          <dd>Each delay in the reverb can be individually modulated
            by 9 smoothed random LFOs. The fourth function of
            the <b>Blend</b> knob (called "reverb") controls the
            amount of modulation applied by the LFOs to the delay
            time. Small modulations result in subtle chorus and ghost
            tones, large modulations in random pitch shifts.</dd>
          <dt>Modulation speed</dt>
          <dd>The third function of
            the <b>Blend</b> knob (called "feedback") controls the
            speed of these LFOs. It ranges from ~1/100Hz to
            ~100Hz. It has no effect if modulation amount is null.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3 id="resonestor">Resonestor mode</h3>

        <img class="float" src="images/nestor.jpg" />

        <p>It is a dual-voice, four-parts resonator (or comb filter)
          effect with built-in capability for polyphonic
          Karplus-Strong plucked string synthesis, and more. You
          access it by long-pressing the <b>Blend button</b> until
          LEDs become orange, and press it again several times until
          only the second LED is <b>un</b>lit (in other words, if LEDs
          1, 3 and 4 are lit).</p>

        <p>To discover it, put the knobs in the following positions: <b>Size</b>, <b>Density</b>, <b>Stereo spread</b>, <b>Feedback</b> and <b>Reverb</b> fully CCW;
          <b>Pitch</b>, <b>In gain</b>, <b>Position</b>,
          and <b>Texture</b> at 12 o'clock; <b>Dry/Wet</b> fully
          CW.</p>

        <p>Each input feeds one of the two voices/resonators, which
          decay is controlled by the <b>Density</b> knob. Remember
          that <b>In L</b> is normalized to <b>In R</b>, so with
          nothing patched in <b>In R</b>, the <b>In L</b> signal is
          fed to both voices. The pitch of the resonator is controlled
          by the <b>Pitch</b> knob and the <b>V/Oct</b> input, so you
          can "play" the resonator like an oscillator. In fact, each
          voice consists of four "parts" (four resonators), which can
          be set to different pitches to form chords. The <b>Size</b>
          knob sets the chord, borrowed from Braids: unison, detuned,
          fifth etc. The resonators can sound very metallic;
          the <b>Texture</b> knob helps attenuating the high/low
          frequencies each time sound passes through the resonator. At
          12 o'clock, no filtering is applied; CCW is a low-pass
          filter; CW is a band-pass filter. This way, a short sound
          impulse passing through the resonator will have a long decay
          with less and less high (and possibly low) frequency.</p>

        <p>This technique, sending a short noise burst to "excite" a
          resonator, is the so-called Karplus-Strong algorithm to
          synthesize the sound of plucked strings instruments like
          guitars. Here, no need for additional modules: sending a
          trigger to the <b>Trig</b> input will send a short burst of
          noise to one of the voices. The <b>Position</b> knob
          controls the timbre and duration of this burst, roughly
          modelling the position on which the string is struck.</p>

        <p>Up to now, we only discussed one voice. Actually, each
          time a <b>Trig</b> is received, the module switches the
          active voice; therefore, you can get duophony. At any time,
          the knobs (pitch, chord, feedback, damping) control only the
          parameters of the resonators of the active voice; the other
          voice keeps the last parameters it was on. If you are
          satisfied with the sound of the current voice and want to
          keep it running (maybe as a drone, using the other voice for
          melody), press <b>Freeze</b>: it will instantly switch
          voice, and prevent <b>Trig</b> from automatically switching
          voice.</p>

        <p>For the more technically enclined, here is a diagram of how
          it works: <img src="images/resonator-dia.jpg" /> and here is
          a detail on the COMB boxes: <img src="images/comb-dia.jpg"
          /> Delay M sets the pitch of one part. The ratio between
          delay times M and N is the Harmonics parameter.

        <h4>Function description</h4>

        <p>Here is a full description of the parameters and their function:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Decay (<b>Density</b> knob and CV)</dt>
          <dd>Decay time of the current voice. Beyond approx. 3
            o'clock, decay is infinite and the sound sustains
            forever (you can use it as a traditional oscillator).</dd>
          <dt>Pitch (<b>Pitch</b> knob and V/Oct CV)</dt>
          <dd>Base pitch of the current voice. At 12 o'clock, the
            pitch is A3 (220Hz).</dd>
          <dt>Chord (<b>Size</b> knob and CV)</dt>
          <dd>Chord selection for the current voice. Morphs gradually
            between Unison, Fat, Superfat, Fat power, Fat octave,
            Octaves, Power, Major, Major7, Minor7, Minor, Sus2, Sus4,
            Minor9, Major9, Minor11, Major11, and Major11.</dd>
          <dt>Dampening
            (<b>Texture</b> knob and CV)</dt>
          <dd>Controls filtering in the feedback loop of the
            resonator. At 12 o'clock, no filtering is applied; CCW, a
            low-pass filter is applied with a increasingly low cutoff
            frequency; CW, a band-pass filter at the frequency of the
            resonator is applied with an increasingly high
            resonance.</dd>
          <dt>Burst (<b>Trig</b> CV)</dt>
          <dd>A trigger in this input will switch the current voice
            (if <b>Freeze</b> is not active) and send a short burst of
            noise in its resonator.</dd>
          <dt>Position (<b>Position</b> knob and CV)</dt>
          <dd>Controls the timbre and duration of the noise burst.
            CCW, it will be longer and more dampened; CW, it will be
            shorter and more high pitched. At both ends of the knob, the
            burst will be inaudible (too damped or too short), which you
            can use to "mute" a voice.</dd>
          <dt>Freeze (<b>Freeze</b> button and CV)</dt>
          <dd>Switch the current voice, and inhibits further voice
            switch by the <b>Trig</b> CV.</dd>
          <dt>Distortion (first function of <b>Blend</b> knob and CV)</dt>
          <dd>Randomly distorts the timbre of the voices by modulating
          each comb filter by low pass-filtered noise. Fully CCW, the
          modulation amount is maximum but the noise is filtered out
          entirely, so there is no effect. Fully CW, the noise is
          unfiltered, but the modulation amount is null, so there is
          no effect. In between, you get interesting effects, from
          subtle swaying to harsh distortion.</dd>
          <dt>Stereo output (second function of <b>Blend</b> knob and CV)</dt>
          <dd>Assigns each part and voice to an output (<b>Out L</b>
            or <b>Out R</b>). Fully CCW, each voice goes to a different
            output. At 12 o'clock, both voices are equally mixed in both
            output. Fully CW, parts of both voices are distributed on
            both output for a wide stereo effect.</dd>
          <dt>Harmonics (third function of <b>Blend</b> knob and CV)</dt>
          <dd>Simulates striking the harmonics on a string. Fully CCW,
            it has no effect. Fully CW, the second harmonic will ring;
            at 12 o'clock, the third, at 10 the fourth etc.
          </dd>
          <dt>Scatter (fourth function of <b>Blend</b> knob and CV)</dt>
          <dd>Controls the random delay times before the sound (input
            or burst) hits each resonator of the current voice. Used for
            K-S synthesis with a chord, this will give the impression
            that strings are struck sloppily. The delay times are
            randomized at each voice switch.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3 id="granular">Granular mode</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Reversed playback</b>: long-press <b>Freeze</b> to
            toggle reversed playback. When it is on, the Freeze LED
            will flash and each grain will play back in reverse.</li>
          <li>The <b>Texture</b> knob now has asymetric shapes of
            grain envelopes. It morphes between: square, ramp up,
            ramp down, triangle, and triangle with diffuser. Fully
            counter-clockwise, the square shape has particularly sharp
            edges and may click. This is desired (more glitch!); if
            you want the old behaviour, turn the knob up a little bit
            until the click disappears.</li>
          <li>The range of the <b>Size</b> knob has been adjusted to
            produce much smaller grains. Fully counter-clockwise,
            grains are barely hearable spikes; fully clockwise, the
            maximum size is as before.
          <li>The response curve of the Density knob has been
            altered to get easier access to slowly sown grains.</li>
          <li>To cope with the additional computation, Grain
            polyphony has been reduced a bit. This should not be
            noticeable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="pitch">Looping delay and Pitch-shifter mode</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>When a clock is sent to the <b>Trig</b> input,
            the <b>Position</b> knob becomes a clock
            divider/multiplier for the pre-delay: at 12 o'clock, the
            pre-delay takes the value of the clock length;
            clockwise, this clock is divided, and counter-clockwise
            it is multiplied following the rates: 1/16, 3/32, 1/8,
            3/16, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 3/4, 1, 3/2, 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 6/1,
            8/1, 12/1 (borrowed from the Echophon). Note that the
            clock division is limited to the largest division not
            exceeding the maximum delay; beyond this point, the
            Position knob will have no effect. Note also that clock
            synchronization will be more accurate with
            the <b>Size</b> knob fully counter-clockwise.</li>
          <li>In the Mono quality modes, <b>Stereo spread</b>
            crossfades between the left and the right input. Remember
            that the left input is normalized into the right input, so
            with nothing patched in <b>In L</b>, this will have no
            effect.
            <blockquote>
              <i>Patch idea:</i> fully wet and with no feedback,
              if you plug <b>Out R</b> back into <b>In R</b>, and listen
              to <b>In R</b>. This is your feedback loop; <b>Stereo
                spread</b> now cross-fades between the input signal and
              the feedback. You can include other processors in the
              loop; I suggest a modulated band-pass followed by Streams
              in compressor mode.

            </blockquote>
          </li>
          <li>In the Stereo quality modes, <b>Stereo spread</b>
            gradually swaps both output channels. Fully CW, it allows
            to do ping-pong delay effects: each time the sound is fed
            back, the two channels are reversed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="looping">Looping delay</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Reverse mode</b>: long-press <b>Freeze</b> to toggle
          Reverse mode. When in reverse mode and when a loop is
          frozen, it is played back reversed.</li>
          <li>When the pitch is at 0, it now bypasses the pitch
            shifter completely. This drastically enhances the delay
            quality when no pitch-shifting is done, avoiding the
            flanging effect when the delay was used with feedback.
            <blockquote>
              <i>By
                the way</i>: don't forget to calibrate the module after the
              update!</li>
          </blockquote>
          <li>When Freeze is active and delay time is synced to an
            external clock, <b>Size</b> controls the repeat time
            multiplication/division.
          </li>
          <li>Delay time changes are now much faster (there is less
            slew on the knob and CV value).</li>
          <li>The Position knob response has been tweaked to allow
          easier dialing of very short delays.
        </ul>

        <h3 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>calibration has been deported to startup to make room
            for easy mode-switching. To calibrate,
            hold <b>Load/Save</b> while turning the system on. Then,
            follow the instructions from the manual.
          <li>changed long-press time to access the alternative
            modes to 2.5 seconds.</li>
          <li>changed response of the feedback knob to square
            root-ish.</li>
          <li>avoided a constant low-frequency tone build-up at high
            feedbacks</li>
          <li><b>Pitch</b> knob: made a clearer plateau at +12/-12
            semitones, so that octaves up/down are easier to find on
            the knob.
          </li>
          <li>set dry/wet response curve to equal power crossfading
                  (no volume drop anymore at 50%)</li>
          <li>Put the post-processing reverb after dry/wet, so that
          it also affects the dry signal (so you can use Clouds as a
          simple reverb plus its main function)</li>
          <li>Disabled the reverb increase when Freeze was on and
          feedback was up.</li>
        </ul>

                  <li>fixed a bug causing clicks when Size was fully CCW.</li>
                  <li>replace soft-clipping by a limiter in the
                  feedback loop. There is no distortion anymore when
                    the reverb is self-oscillating.</li>
                  <li> made the reverb tail a bit smoother (less
                    "muddy"?)</li>
                  <li>made wet signal significantly louder</li>

                    <li>reduced drastically the slew on the delay time
                      setting. Delay time changes are almost
                      instantaneous now.</li>
                    <li>adjusted delay time knob response for more
                      accurate dialing of short delays.</li>
                    <li>enhanced the quality of pitch shifting.</li>

                <li><b>Granular</b>: lowered grain polyphony
                  a bit to cope with inceased memory need.</li>
                <li>hardware support for Clouds bought after July
                  2015. Merged minor changes from the last official
                  Clouds firmware.</li>
                <li>adjusted HP filter on feedback a bit, to keep more
                  low frequencies.</li>
